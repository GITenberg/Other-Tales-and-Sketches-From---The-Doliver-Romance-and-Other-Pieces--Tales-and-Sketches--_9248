    <h3>
      MY VISIT TO NIAGARA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Never did a pilgrim approach Niagara with deeper enthusiasm than mine. I
      had lingered away from it, and wandered to other scenes, because my
      treasury of anticipated enjoyments, comprising all the wonders of the
      world, had nothing else so magnificent, and I was loath to exchange the
      pleasures of hope for those of memory so soon. At length the day came. The
      stage-coach, with a Frenchman and myself on the back seat, had already
      left Lewiston, and in less than an hour would set us down in Manchester. I
      began to listen for the roar of the cataract, and trembled with a
      sensation like dread, as the moment drew nigh, when its voice of ages must
      roll, for the first time, on my ear. The French gentleman stretched
      himself from the window, and expressed loud admiration, while, by a sudden
      impulse, I threw myself back and closed my eyes. When the scene shut in, I
      was glad to think, that for me the whole burst of Niagara was yet in
      futurity. We rolled on, and entered the village of Manchester, bordering
      on the falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am quite ashamed of myself here. Not that I ran, like a madman to the
      falls, and plunged into the thickest of the spray,&mdash;never stopping to
      breathe, till breathing was impossible: not that I committed this, or any
      other suitable extravagance. On the contrary, I alighted with perfect
      decency and composure, gave my cloak to the black waiter, pointed out my
      baggage, and inquired, not the nearest way to the cataract, but about the
      dinner-hour. The interval was spent in arranging my dress. Within the last
      fifteen minutes, my mind had grown strangely benumbed, and my spirits
      apathetic, with a slight depression, not decided enough to be termed
      sadness. My enthusiasm was in a deathlike slumber. Without aspiring to
      immortality, as he did, I could have imitated that English traveller, who
      turned back from the point where he first heard the thunder of Niagara,
      after crossing the ocean to behold it. Many a Western trader, by the by,
      has performed a similar act of heroism with more heroic simplicity,
      deeming it no such wonderful feat to dine at the hotel and resume his
      route to Buffalo or Lewiston, while the cataract was roaring unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such has often been my apathy, when objects, long sought, and earnestly
      desired, were placed within my reach. After dinner&mdash;at which an
      unwonted and perverse epicurism detained me longer than usual&mdash;I
      lighted a cigar and paced the piazza, minutely attentive to the aspect and
      business of a very ordinary village. Finally, with reluctant step, and the
      feeling of an intruder, I walked towards Goat Island. At the tollhouse,
      there were further excuses for delaying the inevitable moment. My
      signature was required in a huge ledger, containing similar records
      innumerable, many of which I read. The skin of a great sturgeon, and other
      fishes, beasts, and reptiles; a collection of minerals, such as lie in
      heaps near the falls; some Indian moccasins, and other trifles, made of
      deer-skin and embroidered with beads; several newspapers from Montreal,
      New York, and Boston;&mdash;all attracted me in turn. Out of a number of
      twisted sticks, the manufacture of a Tuscarora Indian, I selected one of
      curled maple, curiously convoluted, and adorned with the carved images of
      a snake and a fish. Using this as my pilgrim&rsquo;s staff, I crossed the
      bridge. Above and below me were the rapids, a river of impetuous snow,
      with here and there a dark rock amid its whiteness, resisting all the
      physical fury, as any cold spirit did the moral influences of the scene.
      On reaching Goat Island, which separates the two great segments of the
      falls, I chose the right-hand path, and followed it to the edge of the
      American cascade. There, while the falling sheet was yet invisible, I saw
      the vapor that never vanishes, and the Eternal Rainbow of Niagara.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an afternoon of glorious sunshine, without a cloud, save those of
      the cataracts. I gained an insulated rock, and beheld a broad sheet of
      brilliant and unbroken foam, not shooting in a curved line from the top of
      the precipice, but falling headlong down from height to depth. A narrow
      stream diverged from the main branch, and hurried over the crag by a
      channel of its own, leaving a little pine-clad island and a streak of
      precipice, between itself and the larger sheet. Below arose the mist, on
      which was painted a dazzling sun-bow with two concentric shadows,&mdash;one,
      almost as perfect as the original brightness; and the other, drawn faintly
      round the broken edge of the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I had not half seen Niagara. Following the verge of the island, the
      path led me to the Horseshoe, where the real, broad St. Lawrence, rushing
      along on a level with its banks, pours its whole breadth over a concave
      line of precipice, and thence pursues its course between lofty crags
      towards Ontario. A sort of bridge, two or three feet wide, stretches out
      along the edge of the descending sheet, and hangs upon the rising mist, as
      if that were the foundation of the frail structure. Here I stationed
      myself in the blast of wind, which the rushing river bore along with it.
      The bridge was tremulous beneath me, and marked the tremor of the solid
      earth. I looked along the whitening rapids, and endeavored to distinguish
      a mass of water far above the falls, to follow it to their verge, and go
      down with it, in fancy, to the abyss of clouds and storm. Casting my eyes
      across the river, and every side, I took in the whole scene at a glance,
      and tried to comprehend it in one vast idea. After an hour thus spent, I
      left the bridge, and, by a staircase, winding almost interminably round a
      post, descended to the base of the precipice. From that point, my path lay
      over slippery stones, and among great fragments of the cliff, to the edge
      of the cataract, where the wind at once enveloped me in spray, and perhaps
      dashed the rainbow round me. Were my long desires fulfilled? And had I
      seen Niagara?
    </p>
    <p>
      O that I had never heard of Niagara till I beheld it! Blessed were the
      wanderers of old, who heard its deep roar, sounding through the woods, as
      the summons to an unknown wonder, and approached its awful brink, in all
      the freshness of native feeling. Had its own mysterious voice been the
      first to warn me of its existence, then, indeed, I might have knelt down
      and worshipped. But I had come thither, haunted with a vision of foam and
      fury, and dizzy cliffs, and an ocean tumbling down out of the sky,&mdash;a
      scene, in short, which nature had too much good taste and calm simplicity
      to realize. My mind had struggled to adapt these false conceptions to the
      reality, and finding the effort vain, a wretched sense of disappointment
      weighed me down. I climbed the precipice, and threw myself on the earth,
      feeling that I was unworthy to look at the Great Falls, and careless about
      beholding them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that night, as there has been and will be, for ages past and to come,
      a rushing sound was heard, as if a great tempest were sweeping through the
      air. It mingled with my dreams, and made them full of storm and whirlwind.
      Whenever I awoke, and heard this dread sound in the air, and the windows
      rattling as with a mighty blast, I could not rest again, till looking
      forth, I saw how bright the stars were, and that every leaf in the garden
      was motionless. Never was a summer night more calm to the eye, nor a gale
      of autumn louder to the ear. The rushing sound proceeds from the rapids,
      and the rattling of the casements is but an effect of the vibration of the
      whole house, shaken by the jar of the cataract. The noise of the rapids
      draws the attention from the true voice of Niagara, which is a dull,
      muffed thunder, resounding between the cliffs. I spent a wakeful hour at
      midnight, in distinguishing its reverberations, and rejoiced to find that
      my former awe and enthusiasm were reviving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, and after much contemplation, I came to know, by my own
      feelings, that Niagara is indeed a wonder of the world, and not the less
      wonderful, because time and thought must be employed in comprehending it.
      Casting aside all preconceived notions, and preparation to be dire-struck
      or delighted, the beholder must stand beside it in the simplicity of his
      heart, suffering the mighty scene to work its own impression. Night after
      night, I dreamed of it, and was gladdened every morning by the
      consciousness of a growing capacity to enjoy it. Yet I will not pretend to
      the all-absorbing enthusiasm of some more fortunate spectators, nor deny
      that very trifling causes would draw my eyes and thoughts from the
      cataract.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last day that I was to spend at Niagara, before my departure for the
      Far West, I sat upon the Table Rock. This celebrated station did not now,
      as of old, project fifty feet beyond the line of the precipice, but was
      shattered by the fall of an immense fragment, which lay distant on the
      shore below. Still, on the utmost verge of the rock, with my feet hanging
      over it, I felt as if suspended in the open air. Never before had my mind
      been in such perfect unison with the scene. There were intervals, when I
      was conscious of nothing but the great river, rolling calmly into the
      abyss, rather descending than precipitating itself, and acquiring tenfold
      majesty from its unhurried motion. It came like the march of Destiny. It
      was not taken by surprise, but seemed to have anticipated, in all its
      course through the broad lakes, that it must pour their collected waters
      down this height. The perfect foam of the river, after its descent, and
      the ever-varying shapes of mist, rising up, to become clouds in the sky,
      would be the very picture of confusion, were it merely transient, like the
      rage of a tempest. But when the beholder has stood awhile, and perceives
      no lull in the storm, and considers that the vapor and the foam are as
      everlasting as the rocks which produce them, all this turmoil assumes a
      sort of calmness. It soothes, while it awes the mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning over the cliff, I saw the guide conducting two adventurers behind
      the falls. It was pleasant, from that high seat in the sunshine, to
      observe them struggling against the eternal storm of the lower regions,
      with heads bent down, now faltering, now pressing forward, and finally
      swallowed up in their victory. After their disappearance, a blast rushed
      out with an old hat, which it had swept from one of their heads. The rock,
      to which they were directing their unseen course, is marked, at a fearful
      distance on the exterior of the sheet, by a jet of foam. The attempt to
      reach it appears both poetical and perilous to a looker-on, but may be
      accomplished without much more difficulty or hazard, than in stemming a
      violent northeaster. In a few moments, forth came the children of the
      mist. Dripping and breathless, they crept along the base of the cliff,
      ascended to the guide&rsquo;s cottage, and received, I presume, a certificate of
      their achievement, with three verses of sublime poetry on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      My contemplations were often interrupted by strangers, who came down from
      Forsyth&rsquo;s to take their first view of the falls. A short, ruddy,
      middle-aged gentleman, fresh from Old England, peeped over the rock, and
      evinced his approbation by a broad grin. His spouse, a very robust lady,
      afforded a sweet example of maternal solicitude, being so intent on the
      safety of her little boy that she did not even glance at Niagara. As for
      the child, he gave himself wholly to the enjoyment of a stick of candy.
      Another traveller, a native American, and no rare character among us,
      produced a volume of Captain Hall&rsquo;s tour, and labored earnestly to adjust
      Niagara to the captain&rsquo;s description, departing, at last, without one new
      idea or sensation of his own. The next comer was provided, not with a
      printed book, but with a blank sheet of foolscap, from top to bottom of
      which, by means of an ever-pointed pencil, the cataract was made to
      thunder. In a little talk, which we had together, he awarded his
      approbation to the general view, but censured the position of Goat Island,
      observing that it should have been thrown farther to the right, so as to
      widen the American falls, and contract those of the Horseshoe. Next
      appeared two traders of Michigan, who declared, that, upon the whole, the
      sight was worth looking at, there certainly was an immense water-power
      here; but that, after all, they would go twice as far to see the noble
      stone-works of Lockport, where the Grand Canal is locked down a descent of
      sixty feet. They were succeeded by a young fellow, in a homespun cotton
      dress, with a staff in his hand, and a pack over his shoulders. He
      advanced close to the edge of the rock, where his attention, at first
      wavering among the different components of the scene, finally became fixed
      in the angle of the Horse shoe falls, which is, indeed, the central point
      of interest. His whole soul seemed to go forth and be transported thither,
      till the staff slipped from his relaxed grasp, and falling down&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;struck
      upon the fragment of the Table Rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner I spent some hours, watching the varied impression, made by
      the cataract, on those who disturbed me, and returning to unwearied
      contemplation, when left alone. At length my time came to depart. There is
      a grassy footpath, through the woods, along the summit of the bank, to a
      point whence a causeway, hewn in the side of the precipice, goes winding
      down to the Ferry, about half a mile below the Table Rock. The sun was
      near setting, when I emerged from the shadow of the trees, and began the
      descent. The indirectness of my downward road continually changed the
      point of view, and showed me, in rich and repeated succession, now, the
      whitening rapids and majestic leap of the main river, which appeared more
      deeply massive as the light departed; now, the lovelier picture, yet still
      sublime, of Goat Island, with its rocks and grove, and the lesser falls,
      tumbling over the right bank of the St. Lawrence, like a tributary stream;
      now, the long vista of the river, as it eddied and whirled between the
      cliffs, to pass through Ontario toward the sea, and everywhere to be
      wondered at, for this one unrivalled scene. The golden sunshine tinged the
      sheet of the American cascade, and painted on its heaving spray the broken
      semicircle of a rainbow, heaven&rsquo;s own beauty crowning earth&rsquo;s sublimity.
      My steps were slow, and I paused long at every turn of the descent, as one
      lingers and pauses, who discerns a brighter and brightening excellence in
      what he must soon behold no more. The solitude of the old wilderness now
      reigned over the whole vicinity of the falls. My enjoyment became the more
      rapturous, because no poet shared it, nor wretch devoid of poetry profaned
      it; but the spot so famous through the world was all my own!
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>
      THE ANTIQUE RING.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed: the gem is as bright as a star, and curiously set,&rdquo; said
      Clara Pembertou, examining an antique ring, which her betrothed lover had
      just presented to her, with a very pretty speech. &ldquo;It needs only one thing
      to make it perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Edward Caryl, secretly anxious for the
      credit of his gift. &ldquo;A modern setting, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no! That would destroy the charm at once,&rdquo; replied Clara. &ldquo;It needs
      nothing but a story. I long to know how many times it has been the pledge
      of faith between two lovers, and whether the vows, of which it was the
      symbol, were always kept or often broken. Not that I should be too
      scrupulous about facts. If you happen to be unacquainted with its
      authentic history, so much the better. May it not have sparkled upon a
      queen&rsquo;s finger? Or who knows but it is the very ring which Posthumus
      received from Imogen? In short, you must kindle your imagination at the
      lustre of this diamond, and make a legend for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now such a task&mdash;and doubtless Clara knew it&mdash;was the most
      acceptable that could have been imposed on Edward Caryl. He was one of
      that multitude of young gentlemen&mdash;limbs, or rather twigs of the law&mdash;whose
      names appear in gilt letters on the front of Tudor&rsquo;s Buildings, and other
      places in the vicinity of the Court House, which seem to be the haunt of
      the gentler as well as the severer Muses. Edward, in the dearth of
      clients, was accustomed to employ his much leisure in assisting the growth
      of American Literature, to which good cause he had contributed not a few
      quires of the finest letter-paper, containing some thought, some fancy,
      some depth of feeling, together with a young writer&rsquo;s abundance of
      conceits. Sonnets, stanzas of Tennysonian sweetness, tales imbued with
      German mysticism, versions from Jean Paul, criticisms of the old English
      poets, and essays smacking of Dialistic philosophy, were among his
      multifarious productions. The editors of the fashionable periodicals were
      familiar with his autograph, and inscribed his name in those brilliant
      bead-rolls of ink-stained celebrity, which illustrate the first page of
      their covers. Nor did fame withhold her laurel. Hillard had included him
      among the lights of the New England metropolis, in his Boston Book; Bryant
      had found room for some of his stanzas, in the Selections from American
      Poetry; and Mr. Griswold, in his recent assemblage of the sons and
      daughters of song, had introduced Edward Caryl into the inner court of the
      temple, among his fourscore choicest bards. There was a prospect, indeed,
      of his assuming a still higher and more independent position. Interviews
      had been held with Ticknor, and a correspondence with the Harpers,
      respecting a proposed volume, chiefly to consist of Mr. Caryl&rsquo;s fugitive
      pieces in the Magazines, but to be accompanied with a poem of some length,
      never before published. Not improbably, the public may yet be gratified
      with this collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, we sum up our sketch of Edward Caryl, by pronouncing him,
      though somewhat of a carpet knight in literature, yet no unfavorable
      specimen of a generation of rising writers, whose spirit is such that we
      may reasonably expect creditable attempts from all, and good and beautiful
      results from some. And, it will be observed, Edward was the very man to
      write pretty legends, at a lady&rsquo;s instance, for an old-fashioned diamond
      ring. He took the jewel in his hand, and turned it so as to catch its
      scintillating radiance, as if hoping, in accordance with Clara&rsquo;s
      suggestion, to light up his fancy with that starlike gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall it be a ballad?&mdash;a tale in verse?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Enchanted
      rings often glisten in old English poetry, I think something may be done
      with the subject; but it is fitter for rhyme than prose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Miss Pemberton, &ldquo;we will have no more rhyme than just
      enough for a posy to the ring. You must tell the legend in simple prose;
      and when it is finished, I will make a little party to hear it read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman promised obedience; and going to his pillow, with his
      head full of the familiar spirits that used to be worn in rings, watches,
      and sword-hilts, he had the good fortune to possess himself of an
      available idea in a dream. Connecting this with what he himself chanced to
      know of the ring&rsquo;s real history, his task was done. Clara Pemberton
      invited a select few of her friends, all holding the stanchest faith in
      Edward&rsquo;s genius, and therefore the most genial auditors, if not altogether
      the fairest critics, that a writer could possibly desire. Blessed be woman
      for her faculty of admiration, and especially for her tendency to admire
      with her heart, when man, at most, grants merely a cold approval with his
      mind!

    <h4>
      THE LEGEND
    </h4>
    <p>
      After the death-warrant had been read to the Earl of Essex, and on the
      evening before his appointed execution, the Countess of Shrewsbury paid
      his lordship a visit, and found him, as it appeared, toying childishly
      with a ring. The diamond, that enriched it, glittered like a little star,
      but with a singular tinge of red. The gloomy prison-chamber in the Tower,
      with its deep and narrow windows piercing the walls of stone, was now all
      that the earl possessed of worldly prospect; so that there was the less
      wonder that he should look steadfastly into the gem, and moralize upon
      earth&rsquo;s deceitful splendor, as men in darkness and ruin seldom fail to do.
      But the shrewd observations of the countess,&mdash;an artful and
      unprincipled woman,&mdash;the pretended friend of Essex, but who had come
      to glut her revenge for a deed of scorn which he himself had forgotten,&mdash;her
      keen eye detected a deeper interest attached to this jewel. Even while
      expressing his gratitude for her remembrance of a ruined favorite, and
      condemned criminal, the earl&rsquo;s glance reverted to the ring, as if all that
      remained of time and its affairs were collected within that small golden
      circlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lord,&rdquo; observed the countess, &ldquo;there is surely some matter of
      great moment wherewith this ring is connected, since it, so absorbs your
      mind. A token, it may be, of some fair lady&rsquo;s love,&mdash;alas, poor lady,
      once richest in possessing such a heart! Would you that the jewel be
      returned to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queen! the queen! It was her Majesty&rsquo;s own gift,&rdquo; replied the earl,
      still gazing into the depths of the gem. &ldquo;She took it from her finger, and
      told me, with a smile, that it was an heirloom from her Tudor ancestors,
      and had once been the property of Merlin, the British wizard, who gave it
      to the lady of his love. His art had made this diamond the abiding-place
      of a spirit, which, though of fiendish nature, was bound to work only
      good, so long as the ring was an unviolated pledge of love and faith, both
      with the giver and receiver. But should love prove false, and faith be
      broken, then the evil spirit would work his own devilish will, until the
      ring were purified by becoming the medium of some good and holy act, and
      again the pledge of faithful love. The gem soon lost its virtue; for the
      wizard was murdered by the very lady to whom he gave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An idle legend!&rdquo; said the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; answered Essex, with a melancholy smile. &ldquo;Yet the queen&rsquo;s
      favor, of which this ring was the symbol, has proved my ruin. When death
      is nigh, men converse with dreams and shadows. I have been gazing into the
      diamond, and fancying&mdash;but you will laugh at me&mdash;that I might
      catch a glimpse of the evil spirit there. Do you observe this red glow,&mdash;dusky,
      too, amid all the brightness? It is the token of his presence; and even
      now, methinks, it grows redder and duskier, like an angry sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the earl&rsquo;s manner testified how slight was his credence in
      the enchanted properties of the ring. But there is a kind of playfulness
      that comes in moments of despair, when the reality of misfortune, if
      entirely felt, would crush the soul at once. He now, for a brief space,
      was lost in thought, while the countess contemplated him with malignant
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ring,&rdquo; he resumed, in another tone, &ldquo;alone remains, of all that my
      royal mistress&rsquo;s favor lavished upon her servant. My fortune once shone as
      brightly as the gem. And now, such a darkness has fallen around me,
      methinks it would be no marvel if its gleam&mdash;the sole light of my
      prison-house&mdash;were to be forthwith extinguished; inasmuch as my last
      earthly hope depends upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How say you, my lord?&rdquo; asked the Countess of Shrewsbury. &ldquo;The stone is
      bright; but there should be strange magic in it, if it can keep your hopes
      alive, at this sad hour. Alas! these iron bars and ramparts of the Tower
      are unlike to yield to such a spell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Essex raised his head involuntarily; for there was something in the
      countess&rsquo;s tone that disturbed him, although he could not suspect that an
      enemy had intruded upon the sacred privacy of a prisoner&rsquo;s dungeon, to
      exult over so dark a ruin of such once brilliant fortunes. He looked her
      in the face, but saw nothing to awaken his distrust. It would have
      required a keener eye than even Cecil&rsquo;s to read the secret of a
      countenance, which had been worn so long in the false light of a court,
      that it was now little better than a mask, telling any story save the true
      one. The condemned nobleman again bent over the ring, and proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It once had power in it,&mdash;this bright gem,&mdash;the magic that
      appertains to the talisman of a great queen&rsquo;s favor. She bade me, if
      hereafter I should fall into her disgrace,&mdash;how deep soever, and
      whatever might be the crime,&mdash;to convey this jewel to her sight, and
      it should plead for me. Doubtless, with her piercing judgment, she had
      even then detected the rashness of my nature, and foreboded some such deed
      as has now brought destruction upon my bead. And knowing, too, her own
      hereditary rigor, she designed, it may be, that the memory of gentler and
      kindlier hours should soften her heart in my behalf, when my need should
      be the greatest. I have doubted,&mdash;I have distrusted,&mdash;yet who
      can tell, even now, what happy influence this ring might have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have delayed full long to show the ring, and plead her Majesty&rsquo;s
      gracious promise,&rdquo; remarked the countess,&mdash;&ldquo;your state being what it
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied the earl: &ldquo;but for my honor&rsquo;s sake, I was loath to entreat
      the queen&rsquo;s mercy, while I might hope for life, at least, from the justice
      of the laws. If, on a trial by my peers, I had been acquitted of
      meditating violence against her sacred life, then would I have fallen at
      her feet, and presenting the jewel, have prayed no other favor than that
      my love and zeal should be put to the severest test. But now&mdash;it were
      confessing too much&mdash;it were cringing too low&mdash;to beg the
      miserable gift of life, on no other score than the tenderness which her
      Majesty deems one to have forfeited!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it is your only hope,&rdquo; said the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; continued Essex, pursuing his own reflections, &ldquo;of what
      avail will be this token of womanly feeling, when, on the other hand, are
      arrayed the all-prevailing motives of state policy, and the artifices and
      intrigues of courtiers, to consummate my downfall? Will Cecil or Raleigh
      suffer her heart to act for itself, even if the spirit of her father were
      not in her? It is in vain to hope it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But still Essex gazed at the ring with an absorbed attention, that proved
      how much hope his sanguine temperament had concentrated here, when there
      was none else for him in the wide world, save what lay in the compass of
      that hoop of gold. The spark of brightness within the diamond, which
      gleamed like an intenser than earthly fire, was the memorial of his
      dazzling career. It had not paled with the waning sunshine of his
      mistress&rsquo;s favor; on the contrary, in spite of its remarkable tinge of
      dusky red, he fancied that it never shone so brightly. The glow of festal
      torches,&mdash;the blaze of perfumed lamps,&mdash;bonfires that had been
      kindled for him, when he was the darling of the people,&mdash;the splendor
      of the royal court, where he had been the peculiar star,&mdash;all seemed
      to have collected their moral or material glory into the gem, and to burn
      with a radiance caught from the future, as well as gathered from the past.
      That radiance might break forth again. Bursting from the diamond, into
      which it was now narrowed, it might been first upon the gloomy walls of
      the Tower,&mdash;then wider, wider, wider,&mdash;till all England, and the
      seas around her cliffs, should be gladdened with the light. It was such an
      ecstasy as often ensues after long depression, and has been supposed to
      precede the circumstances of darkest fate that may befall mortal man. The
      earl pressed the ring to his heart as if it were indeed a talisman, the
      habitation of a spirit, as the queen had playfully assured him,&mdash;but
      a spirit of happier influences than her legend spake of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, could I but make my way to her footstool!&rdquo; cried he, waving his hand
      aloft, while he paced the stone pavement of his prison-chamber with an
      impetuous step. &ldquo;I might kneel down, indeed, a ruined man, condemned to
      the block, but how should I rise again? Once more the favorite of
      Elizabeth!&mdash;England&rsquo;s proudest noble!&mdash;with such prospects as
      ambition never aimed at! Why have I tarried so long in this weary dungeon?
      The ring has power to set me free! The palace wants me! Ho, jailer, unbar
      the door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But then occurred the recollection of the impossibility of obtaining an
      interview with his fatally estranged mistress, and testing the influence
      over her affections, which he still flattered himself with possessing.
      Could he step beyond the limits of his prison, the world would be all
      sunshine; but here was only gloom and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said he, slowly and sadly, letting his head fall upon his hands.
      &ldquo;I die for the lack of one blessed word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Countess of Shrewsbury, herself forgotten amid the earl&rsquo;s gorgeous
      visions, had watched him with an aspect that could have betrayed nothing
      to the most suspicious observer; unless that it was too calm for humanity,
      while witnessing the flutterings, as it were, of a generous heart in the
      death-agony. She now approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what mean you to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&mdash;my deeds are done!&rdquo; replied he, despondingly; &ldquo;yet, had a
      fallen favorite any friends, I would entreat one of them to lay this ring
      at her Majesty&rsquo;s feet; albeit with little hope, save that, hereafter, it
      might remind her that poor Essex, once far too highly favored, was at last
      too severely dealt with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be that friend,&rdquo; said the countess. &ldquo;There is no time to be lost.
      Trust this precious ring with me. This very night the queen&rsquo;s eye shall
      rest upon it; nor shall the efficacy of my poor words be wanting, to
      strengthen the impression which it will doubtless make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The earl&rsquo;s first impulse was to hold out the ring. But looking at the
      countess, as she bent forward to receive it, he fancied that the red glow
      of the gem tinged all her face, and gave it an ominous expression. Many
      passages of past times recurred to his memory. A preternatural insight,
      perchance caught from approaching death, threw its momentary gleam, as
      from a meteor, all round his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Countess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know not wherefore I hesitate, being in a plight
      so desperate, and having so little choice of friends. But have you looked
      into your own heart? Can you perform this office with the truth&mdash;the
      earnestness&mdash;time&mdash;zeal, even to tears, and agony of spirit&mdash;wherewith
      the holy gift of human life should be pleaded for? Woe be unto you, should
      you undertake this task, and deal towards me otherwise than with utmost
      faith! For your own soul&rsquo;s sake, and as you would have peace at your
      death-hour, consider well in what spirit you receive this ring!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The countess did not shrink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord!&mdash;my good lord!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;wrong not a woman&rsquo;s heart
      by these suspicious. You might choose another messenger; but who, save a
      lady of her bedchamber, can obtain access to the queen at this untimely
      hour? It is for your life,&mdash;for your life,&mdash;else I would not
      renew my offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the ring,&rdquo; said the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe that it shall be in the queen&rsquo;s hands before the lapse of another
      hour,&rdquo; replied the countess, as she received this sacred trust of life and
      death. &ldquo;To-morrow morning look for the result of my intercession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She departed. Again the earl&rsquo;s hopes rose high. Dreams visited his
      slumber, not of the sable-decked scaffold in the Tower-yard, but of
      canopies of state, obsequious courtiers, pomp, splendor, the smile of the
      once more gracious queen, and a light beaming from the magic gem, which
      illuminated his whole future.
    </p>
    <p>
      History records how foully the Countess of Shrewsbury betrayed the trust,
      which Essex, in his utmost need, confided to her. She kept the ring, and
      stood in the presence of Elizabeth, that night, without one attempt to
      soften her stern hereditary temper in behalf of the former favorite. The
      next day the earl&rsquo;s noble head rolled upon the scaffold. On her death-bed,
      tortured, at last, with a sense of the dreadful guilt which she had taken
      upon her soul, the wicked countess sent for Elizabeth, revealed the story
      of the ring, and besought forgiveness for her treachery. But the queen,
      still obdurate, even while remorse for past obduracy was tugging at her
      heart-strings, shook the dying woman in her bed, as if struggling with
      death for the privilege of wreaking her revenge and spite. The spirit of
      the countess passed away, to undergo the justice, or receive the mercy, of
      a higher tribunal; and tradition says, that the fatal ring was found upon
      her breast, where it had imprinted a dark red circle, resembling the
      effect of the intensest heat. The attendants, who prepared the body for
      burial, shuddered, whispering one to another, that the ring must have
      derived its heat from the glow of infernal fire. They left it on her
      breast, in the coffin, and it went with that guilty woman to the tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years afterward, when the church, that contained the monuments of the
      Shrewsbury family, was desecrated by Cromwell&rsquo;s soldiers, they broke open
      the ancestral vaults, and stole whatever was valuable from the noble
      personages who reposed there. Merlin&rsquo;s antique ring passed into the
      possession of a stout sergeant of the Ironsides, who thus became subject
      to the influences of the evil spirit that still kept his abode within the
      gem&rsquo;s enchanted depths. The sergeant was soon slain in battle, thus
      transmitting the ring, though without any legal form of testament, to a
      gay cavalier, who forthwith pawned it, and expended the money in liquor,
      which speedily brought him to the grave. We next catch the sparkle of the
      magic diamond at various epochs of the merry reign of Charles the Second.
      But its sinister fortune still attended it. From whatever hand this ring
      of portent came, and whatever finger it encircled, ever it was the pledge
      of deceit between man and man, or man and woman, of faithless vows, and
      unhallowed passion; and whether to lords and ladies, or to village-maids,&mdash;for
      sometimes it found its way so low,&mdash;still it brought nothing but
      sorrow and disgrace. No purifying deed was done, to drive the fiend from
      his bright home in this little star. Again, we hear of it at a later
      period, when Sir Robert Walpole bestowed the ring, among far richer
      jewels, on the lady of a British legislator, whose political honor he
      wished to undermine. Many a dismal and unhappy tale might be wrought out
      of its other adventures. All this while, its ominous tinge of dusky red
      had been deepening and darkening, until, if laid upon white paper, it cast
      the mingled hue of night and blood, strangely illuminated with
      scintillating light, in a circle round about. But this peculiarity only
      made it the more valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, the fatal ring! When shall its dark secret be discovered, and the
      doom of ill, inherited from one possessor to another, be finally revoked?
    </p>
    <p>
      The legend now crosses the Atlantic, and comes down to our own immediate
      time. In a certain church of our city, not many evenings ago, there was a
      contribution for a charitable object. A fervid preacher had poured out his
      whole soul in a rich and tender discourse, which had at least excited the
      tears, and perhaps the more effectual sympathy, of a numerous audience.
      While the choristers sang sweetly, and the organ poured forth its
      melodious thunder, the deacons passed up and down the aisles, and along
      the galleries, presenting their mahogany boxes, in which each person
      deposited whatever sum he deemed it safe to lend to the Lord, in aid of
      human wretchedness. Charity became audible,&mdash;chink, chink, chink,&mdash;as
      it fell, drop by drop, into the common receptacle. There was a hum,&mdash;a
      stir,&mdash;the subdued bustle of people putting their hands into their
      pockets; while, ever and anon, a vagrant coin fell upon the floor, and
      rolled away, with long reverberation, into some inscrutable corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, all having been favored with an opportunity to be generous, the
      two deacons placed their boxes on the communion-table, and thence, at the
      conclusion of the services, removed them into the vestry. Here these good
      old gentlemen sat down together, to reckon the accumulated treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, fie, Brother Tilton,&rdquo; said Deacon Trott, peeping into Deacon
      Tilton&rsquo;s box, &ldquo;what a heap of copper you have picked up! Really, for an
      old man, you must have had a heavy job to lug it along. Copper! copper!
      copper! Do people expect to get admittance into heaven at the price of a
      few coppers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wrong them, brother,&rdquo; answered Deacon Tilton, a simple and kindly
      old man. &ldquo;Copper may do more for one person, than gold will for another.
      In the galleries, where I present my box, we must not expect such a
      harvest as you gather among the gentry in the broad aisle, and all over
      the floor of the church. My people are chiefly poor mechanics and
      laborers, sailors, seamstresses, and servant-maids, with a most
      uncomfortable intermixture of roguish school-boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Deacon Trott; &ldquo;but there is a great deal, Brother
      Tilton, in the method of presenting a contribution-box. It is a knack that
      comes by nature, or not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They now proceeded to sum up the avails of the evening, beginning with the
      receipts of Deacon Trott. In good sooth, that worthy personage had reaped
      an abundant harvest, in which he prided himself no less, apparently, than
      if every dollar had been contributed from his own individual pocket. Had
      the good deacon been meditating a jaunt to Texas, the treasures of the
      mahogany box might have sent him on his way rejoicing. There were
      bank-notes, mostly, it is true, of the smallest denominations in the
      giver&rsquo;s pocket-book, yet making a goodly average upon the whole. The most
      splendid contribution was a check for a hundred dollars, bearing the name
      of a distinguished merchant, whose liberality was duly celebrated in the
      newspapers of the next day. No less than seven half-eagles, together with
      an English sovereign, glittered amidst an indiscriminate heap of silver;
      the box being polluted with nothing of the copper kind, except a single
      bright new cent, wherewith a little boy had performed his first charitable
      act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! very well indeed!&rdquo; said Deacon Trott, self-approvingly. &ldquo;A
      handsome evening&rsquo;s work! And now, Brother Tilton, let&rsquo;s see whether you
      can match it.&rdquo; Here was a sad contrast! They poured forth Deacon Tilton&rsquo;s
      treasure upon the table, and it really seemed as if the whole copper
      coinage of the country, together with an amazing quantity of shop-keeper&rsquo;s
      tokens, and English and Irish half-pence, mostly of base metal, had been
      congregated into the box. There was a very substantial pencil-case, and
      the semblance of a shilling; but he latter proved to be made of tin, and
      the former of German-silver. A gilded brass button was doing duty as a
      gold coin, and a folded shopbill had assumed the character of a bank-note.
      But Deacon Tilton&rsquo;s feelings were much revived by the aspect of another
      bank-note, new and crisp, adorned with beautiful engravings, and stamped
      with the indubitable word, TWENTY, in large black letters. Alas! it was a
      counterfeit. In short, the poor old Deacon was no less unfortunate than
      those who trade with fairies, and whose gains are sure to be transformed
      into dried leaves, pebbles, and other valuables of that kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe the Evil One is in the box,&rdquo; said he, with some vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, Deacon Tilton!&rdquo; cried his Brother Trott, with a hearty laugh.
      &ldquo;You ought to have a statue in copper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, brother,&rdquo; replied the good Deacon, recovering his temper.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bestow ten dollars from my own pocket, and may heaven&rsquo;s blessing go
      along with it. But look! what do you call this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the copper mountain, which it had cost them so much toil to remove,
      lay an antique ring! It was enriched with a diamond, which, so soon as it
      caught the light, began to twinkle and glimmer, emitting the whitest and
      purest lustre that could possibly be conceived.&mdash;It was as brilliant
      as if some magician had condensed the brightest star in heaven into a
      compass fit to be set in a ring, for a lady&rsquo;s delicate finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; said Deacon Trott, examining it carefully, in the
      expectation of finding it as worthless as the rest of his colleague&rsquo;s
      treasure. &ldquo;Why, upon my word, this seems to be a real diamond, and of the
      purest water. Whence could it have come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I cannot tell,&rdquo; quoth Deacon Tilton, &ldquo;for my spectacles were so
      misty that all faces looked alike. But now I remember, there was a flash
      of light came from the box, at one moment; but it seemed a dusky red,
      instead of a pure white, like the sparkle of this gem. Well; the ring will
      make up for the copper; but I wish the giver had thrown its history into
      the box along with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It has been our good luck to recover a portion of that history. After
      transmitting misfortune from one possessor to another, ever since the days
      of British Merlin, the identical ring which Queen Elizabeth gave to the
      Earl of Essex was finally thrown into the contribution-box of a New
      England church. The two deacons deposited it in the glass case of a
      fashionable jeweller, of whom it was purchased by the humble rehearser of
      this legend, in the hope that it may be allowed to sparkle on a fair
      lady&rsquo;s finger. Purified from the foul fiend, so long its inhabitant, by a
      deed of unostentatious charity, and now made the symbol of faithful and
      devoted love, the gentle bosom of its new possessor need fear no sorrow
      from its influence.

    <p>
      Very pretty!&mdash;Beautiful!&mdash;How original!&mdash;How sweetly
      written!&mdash;What nature!&mdash;What imagination!&mdash;What power!&mdash;What
      pathos!&mdash;What exquisite humor!&rdquo;&mdash;were the exclamations of Edward
      Caryl&rsquo;s kind and generous auditors, at the conclusion of the legend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pretty tale,&rdquo; said Miss Pemberton, who, conscious that her praise
      was to that of all others as a diamond to a pebble, was therefore the less
      liberal in awarding it. &ldquo;It is really a pretty tale, and very proper for
      any of the Annuals. But, Edward, your moral does not satisfy me. What
      thought did you embody in the ring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Clara, this is too bad!&rdquo; replied Edward, with a half-reproachful smile.
      &ldquo;You know that I can never separate the idea from the symbol in which it
      manifests itself. However, we may suppose the Gem to be the human heart,
      and the Evil Spirit to be Falsehood, which, in one guise or another, is
      the fiend that causes all the sorrow and trouble in the world. I beseech
      you to let this suffice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall,&rdquo; said Clara, kindly. &ldquo;And, believe me, whatever the world may
      say of the story, I prize it far above the diamond which enkindled your
      imagination.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      GRAVES AND GOBLINS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now talk we of graves and goblins! Fit themes,&mdash;start not! gentle
      reader,&mdash;fit for a ghost like me. Yes; though an earth-clogged fancy
      is laboring with these conceptions, and an earthly hand will write them
      down, for mortal eyes to read, still their essence flows from as airy a
      ghost as ever basked in the pale starlight, at twelve o&rsquo;clock. Judge them
      not by the gross and heavy form in which they now appear. They may be
      gross, indeed, with the earthly pollution contracted from the brain,
      through which they pass; and heavy with the burden of mortal language,
      that crushes all the finer intelligences of the soul. This is no fault of
      mine. But should aught of ethereal spirit be perceptible, yet scarcely so,
      glimmering along the dull train of words,&mdash;should a faint perfume
      breathe from the mass of clay,&mdash;then, gentle reader, thank the ghost,
      who thus embodies himself for your sake! Will you believe me, if I say
      that all true and noble thoughts, and elevated imaginations, are but
      partly the offspring of the intellect which seems to produce them?
      Sprites, that were poets once, and are now all poetry, hover round the
      dreaming bard, and become his inspiration; buried statesmen lend their
      wisdom, gathered on earth and mellowed in the grave, to the historian; and
      when the preacher rises nearest to the level of his mighty subject, it is
      because the prophets of old days have communed with him. Who has not been
      conscious of mysteries within his mind, mysteries of truth and reality,
      which will not wear the chains of language? Mortal, then the dead were
      with you! And thus shall the earth-dulled soul, whom I inspire, be
      conscious of a misty brightness among his thoughts, and strive to make it
      gleam upon the page,&mdash;but all in vain. Poor author! How will he
      despise what he can grasp, for the sake of the dim glory that eludes him!
    </p>
    <p>
      So talk we of graves and goblins. But, what have ghosts to do with graves?
      Mortal man, wearing the dust which shall require a sepulchre, might deem
      it more a home and resting-place than a spirit can, whose earthly clod has
      returned to earth. Thus philosophers have reasoned. Yet wiser they who
      adhere to the ancient sentiment, that a phantom haunts and hallows the
      marble tomb or grassy hillock where its material form was laid. Till
      purified from each stain of clay; till the passions of the living world
      are all forgotten; till it have less brotherhood with the wayfarers of
      earth, than with spirits that never wore mortality,&mdash;the ghost must
      linger round the grave. O, it is a long and dreary watch to some of us!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in early childhood, I had selected a sweet spot, of shade and
      glimmering sunshine, for my grave. It was no burial-ground, but a secluded
      nook of virgin earth, where I used to sit, whole summer afternoons,
      dreaming about life and death. My fancy ripened prematurely, and taught me
      secrets which I could not otherwise have known. I pictured the coming
      years,&mdash;they never came to me, indeed; but I pictured them like life,
      and made this spot the scene of all that should be brightest, in youth,
      manhood, and old age. There, in a little while, it would be time for me to
      breathe the bashful and burning vows of first-love; thither, after
      gathering fame abroad, I would return to enjoy the loud plaudit of the
      world, a vast but unobtrusive sound, like the booming of a distant sea;
      and thither, at the far-off close of life, an aged man would come, to
      dream, as the boy was dreaming, and be as happy in the past as lie was in
      futurity. Finally, when all should be finished, in that spot so hallowed,
      in that soil so impregnated with the most precious of my bliss, there was
      to be my grave. Methought it would be the sweetest grave that ever a
      mortal frame reposed in, or an ethereal spirit haunted. There, too, in
      future times, drawn thither by the spell which I had breathed around the
      place, boyhood would sport and dream, and youth would love, and manhood
      would enjoy, and age would dream again, and my ghost would watch but never
      frighten them. Alas, the vanity of mortal projects, even when they centre
      in the grave! I died in my first youth, before I had been a lover; at a
      distance, also, from the grave which fancy had dug for me; and they buried
      me in the thronged cemetery of a town, where my marble slab stands
      unnoticed amid a hundred others. And there are coffins on each side of
      mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, poor ghost!&rdquo; will the reader say. Yet I am a happy ghost enough,
      and disposed to be contented with my grave, if the sexton will but let it
      be my own, and bring no other dead man to dispute my title. Earth has left
      few stains upon me, and it will be but a short time that I need haunt the
      place. It is good to die in early youth. Had I lived out threescore years
      and ten, or half of them, my spirit would have been so earth-incrusted,
      that centuries might not have purified it for a better home than the dark
      precincts of the grave. Meantime, there is good choice of company amongst
      us. From twilight till near sunrise, we are gliding to and fro, some in
      the graveyard, others miles away; and would we speak with any friend, we
      do but knock against his tombstone, and pronounce the name engraved on it:
      in an instant, there the shadow stands!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some are ghosts of considerable antiquity. There is an old man, hereabout;
      he never had a tombstone, and is often puzzled to distinguish his own
      grave; but hereabouts he haunts, and long is doomed to haunt. He was a
      miser in his lifetime, and buried a strong box of ill-gotten gold, almost
      fresh from the mint, in the coinage of William and Mary. Scarcely was it
      safe, when the sexton buried the old man and his secret with him. I could
      point out the place where the treasure lies; it was at the bottom of the
      miser&rsquo;s garden; but a paved thoroughfare now passes beside the spot, and
      the cornerstone of a market-house presses right down upon it. Had the
      workmen dug six inches deeper, they would have found the hoard. Now
      thither must this poor old miser go, whether in starlight, moonshine, or
      pitch darkness, and brood above his worthless treasure, recalling all the
      petty crimes by which he gained it. Not a coin must he fail to reckon in
      his memory, nor forget a pennyworth of the sin that made up the sum,
      though his agony is such as if the pieces of gold, red-hot, were stamped
      into his naked soul. Often, while he is in torment there, he hears the
      steps of living men, who love the dross of earth as well as he did. May
      they never groan over their miserable wealth like him! Night after night,
      for above a hundred years, hath he done this penance, and still must he do
      it, till the iron box be brought to light, and each separate coin be
      cleansed by grateful tears of a widow or an orphan. My spirit sighs for
      his long vigil at the corner of the market-house!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are ghosts whom I tremble to meet, and cannot think of without a
      shudder. One has the guilt of blood upon him. The soul which he thrust
      untimely forth has long since been summoned from our gloomy graveyard, and
      dwells among the stars of heaven, too far and too high for even the
      recollection of mortal anguish to ascend thither. Not so the murderer&rsquo;s
      ghost! It is his doom to spend all the hours of darkness in the spot which
      he stained with innocent blood, and to feel the hot stream&mdash;hot as
      when it first gushed upon his hand&mdash;incorporating itself with his
      spiritual substance. Thus his horrible crime is ever fresh within him. Two
      other wretches are condemned to walk arm in arm. They were guilty lovers
      in their lives, and still, in death, must wear the guise of love, though
      hatred and loathing have become their very nature and existence. The
      pollution of their mutual sin remains with them, and makes their souls
      sick continually. O, that I might forget all the dark shadows which haunt
      about these graves! This passing thought of them has left a stain, and
      will weigh me down among dust and sorrow, beyond the time that my own
      transgressions would have kept me here. There is one shade among us, whose
      high nature it is good to meditate upon. He lived a patriot, and is a
      patriot still. Posterity has forgotten him. The simple slab, of red
      freestone, that bore his name, was broken long ago, and is now covered by
      the gradual accumulation of the soil. A tuft of thistles is his only
      monument. This upright spirit came to his grave, after a lengthened life,
      with so little stain of earth, that he might, almost immediately, have
      trodden the pathway of the sky. But his strong love of country chained him
      down, to share its vicissitudes of weal or woe. With such deep yearning in
      his soul, he was unfit for heaven. That noblest virtue has the effect of
      sin, and keeps his pure and lofty spirit in a penance, which may not
      terminate till America be again a wilderness. Not that there is no joy for
      the dead patriot. Can he fail to experience it, while be contemplates the
      mighty and increasing power of the land, which be protected in its
      infancy? No; there is much to gladden him. But sometimes I dread to meet
      him, as he returns from the bedchambers of rulers and politicians, after
      diving into their secret motives, and searching out their aims. He looks
      round him with a stern and awful sadness, and vanishes into his neglected
      grave. Let nothing sordid or selfish defile your deeds or thoughts, ye
      great men of the day, lest ye grieve the noble dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few ghosts take such an endearing interest as this, even in their own
      private affairs. It made me rather sad, at first, to find how soon the
      flame of love expires amid the chill damps of the tomb; so much the
      sooner, the more fiercely it may have burned. Forget your dead mistress,
      youth! She has already forgotten you. Maiden, cease to weep for your
      buried lover! He will know nothing of your tears, nor value them if he
      did. Yet it were blasphemy to say that true love is other than immortal.
      It is an earthly passion, of which I speak, mingled with little that is
      spiritual, and must therefore perish with the perishing clay. When souls
      have loved, there is no falsehood or forgetfulness. Maternal affection,
      too, is strong as adamant. There are mothers here, among us, who might
      have been in heaven fifty years ago, if they could forbear to cherish
      earthly joy and sorrow, reflected from the bosoms of their children.
      Husbands and wives have a comfortable gift of oblivion, especially when
      secure of the faith of their living halves. Jealousy, it is true, will
      play the devil with a ghost, driving him to the bedside of secondary
      wedlock, there to scowl, unseen, and gibber inaudible remonstrances. Dead
      wives, however jealous in their lifetime, seldom feel this posthumous
      torment so acutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many, many things, that appear most important while we walk the busy
      street, lose all their interest the moment we are borne into the quiet
      graveyard which borders it. For my own part, my spirit had not become so
      mixed up with earthly existence, as to be now held in an unnatural
      combination, or tortured much with retrospective cares. I still love my
      parents and a younger sister, who remain among the living, and often
      grieve me by their patient sorrow for the dead. Each separate tear of
      theirs is an added weight upon my soul, and lengthens my stay among the
      graves. As to other matters, it exceedingly rejoices me, that my summons
      came before I had time to write a projected poem, which was highly
      imaginative in conception, and could not have failed to give me a
      triumphant rank in the choir of our native bards. Nothing is so much to be
      deprecated as posthumous renown. It keeps the immortal spirit from the
      proper bliss of his celestial state, and causes him to feed upon the
      impure breath of mortal man, till sometimes he forgets that there are
      starry realms above him. Few poets&mdash;infatuated that they are!&mdash;soar
      upward while the least whisper of their name is heard on earth. On Sabbath
      evenings, my sisters sit by the fireside, between our father and mother,
      and repeat some hymns of mine, which they have often heard from my own
      lips, ere the tremulous voice left them forever. Little do they think,
      those dear ones, that the dead stands listening in the glimmer of the
      firelight, and is almost gifted with a visible shape by the fond intensity
      of their remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now shall the reader know a grief of the poor ghost that speaks to him; a
      grief, but not a helpless one. Since I have dwelt among the graves, they
      bore the corpse of a young maiden hither, and laid her in the old
      ancestral vault, which is hollowed in the side of a grassy bank. It has a
      door of stone, with rusty iron hinges, and above it, a rude sculpture of
      the family arms, and inscriptions of all their names who have been buried
      there, including sire and son, mother and daughter, of an ancient colonial
      race. All of her lineage had gone before, and when the young maiden
      followed, the portal was closed forever. The night after her burial, when
      the other ghosts were flitting about their graves, forth came the pale
      virgin&rsquo;s shadow, with the rest, but knew not whither to go, nor whom to
      haunt, so lonesome had she been on earth. She stood by the ancient
      sepulchre, looking upward to the bright stars, as if she would, even then,
      begin her flight. Her sadness made me sad. That night and the next, I
      stood near her, in the moonshine, but dared not speak, because she seemed
      purer than all the ghosts, and fitter to converse with angels than with
      men. But the third bright eve, still gazing upward to the glory of the
      heavens, she sighed, and said, &ldquo;When will my mother come for me?&rdquo; Her low,
      sweet voice emboldened me to speak, and she was kind and gentle, though so
      pure, and answered me again. From that time, always at the ghostly hour, I
      sought the old tomb of her fathers, and either found her standing by the
      door, or knocked, and she appeared. Blessed creature, that she was; her
      chaste spirit hallowed mine, and imparted such a celestial buoyancy, that
      I longed to grasp her hand, and fly,&mdash;upward, aloft, aloft! I
      thought, too, that she only lingered here, till my earthlier soul should
      be purified for heaven. One night, when the stars threw down the light
      that shadows love, I stole forth to the accustomed spot, and knocked, with
      my airy fingers, at her door. She answered not. Again I knocked, and
      breathed her name. Where was she? At once, the truth fell on my miserable
      spirit, and crushed it to the earth, among dead men&rsquo;s bones and mouldering
      dust, groaning in cold and desolate agony. Her penance was over! She had
      taken her trackless flight, and had found a home in the purest radiance of
      the upper stars, leaving me to knock at the stone portal of the darksome
      sepulchre. But I know&mdash;I know, that angels hurried her away, or
      surely she would have whispered ere she fled!
    </p>
    <p>
      She is gone! How could the grave imprison that unspotted one! But her
      pure, ethereal spirit will not quite forget me, nor soar too high in
      bliss, till I ascend to join her. Soon, soon be that hour! I am weary of
      the earth-damps; they burden me; they choke me! Already, I can float in
      the moonshine; the faint starlight will almost bear up my footsteps; the
      perfume of flowers, which grosser spirits love, is now too earthly a
      luxury for me. Grave! Grave! thou art not my home. I must flit a little
      longer in thy night gloom, and then be gone,&mdash;far from the dust of
      the living and the dead,&mdash;far from the corruption that is around me,
      but no more within!
    </p>
    <p>
      A few times, I have visited the chamber of one who walks, obscure and
      lonely, on his mortal pilgrimage. He will leave not many living friends,
      when he goes to join the dead, where his thoughts often stray, and he
      might better be. I steal into his sleep, and play my part among the
      figures of his dreams. I glide through the moonlight of his waking fancy,
      and whisper conceptions, which, with a strange thrill of fear, he writes
      down as his own. I stand beside him now, at midnight, telling these dreamy
      truths with a voice so dream-like, that he mistakes them for fictions of a
      brain too prone to such. Yet he glances behind him and shivers, while the
      lamp burns pale. Farewell, dreamer,&mdash;waking or sleeping! Your
      brightest dreams are fled; your mind grows too hard and cold for a
      spiritual guest to enter; you are earthly, too, and have all the sins of
      earth. The ghost will visit you no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where is the maiden, holy and pure, though wearing a form of clay,
      that would have me bend over her pillow at midnight, and leave a blessing
      there? With a silent invocation, let her summon me. Shrink not, maiden,
      when I come! In life, I was a high-souled youth, meditative, yet seldom
      sad, full of chaste fancies, and stainless from all grosser sin. And now,
      ill death, I bring no loathsome smell of the grave, nor ghostly terrors,&mdash;but
      gentle, and soothing, and sweetly pensive influences. Perhaps, just
      fluttering for the skies, my visit may hallow the wellsprings of thy
      thought, and make thee heavenly here on earth. Then shall pure dreams and
      holy meditations bless thy life; nor thy sainted spirit linger round the
      grave, but seek the upper stars, and meet me there!

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
